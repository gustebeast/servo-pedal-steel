"""Belt-tension lock forks — a graded set of tiny printed plugs (§ motors).

The motor mounts are friction clamps in slotted holes; the slots point at the
screw pulley, so long-term clamp creep could let a motor walk +X and slacken
its belt. A direct tensioner (set screw / U-channel) doesn't fit: the staircase
packs motors 1.7 mm apart in X. Instead, the slots stay (continuous tension),
and after torquing a motor, a FORK of the matching size slips into each slot's
open +X remainder, between the M3 shank and the slot's end wall. Belt tension
then bears screw → fork → solid wall: a positive mechanical stop, no friction
reliance. To re-tension: loosen, pull the forks, slide, re-fork.

The tensioned gap is always 3.2..6.2 mm (slot half-length 4.7, shank +X edge at
travel −3..0 → +1.5..+4.5), so the set runs L = 3.0..6.0 in 0.2 steps: pick the
longest that drops in; residual play ≤ 0.2 mm. Body height 3.25 slips the
3.4 slot; depth stops 0.3 shy of the motor face; a 1.2 head flange stays proud
on the +Y wall face for fingernail removal. One STEP = the whole 11-size set
(separate bodies; print the plate flat, 4 forks of the chosen size per motor).
